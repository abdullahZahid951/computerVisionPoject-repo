# computerVisionPoject-repo
Using Computer Vision Techniques to identify glomerulus and blood vessels in the kidney (histopathology slides).
The project will be coded in Python.
Initially, we'll write some code to plot some differences in initial images using a .jasonL 
file then apply some of algos to differentiate between **glomerulus** and **blood vessels**.
Initially, we'll be working with tiles ( parts of a large image  ) after successful results they'll be tiled as
Whole Slide Images.
After this we'll apply some computer vision Project Principle to teach computer to produce efficient results on its own.
This is basic work flow of the project we'll update as we go along.
