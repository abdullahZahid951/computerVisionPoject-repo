# computerVisionPoject-repo
- Using Computer Vision Techniques to identify glomerulus and blood vessels in the kidney (histopathology slides).
- The project will be coded in Python.
- Initially, we'll write some code to plot some differences in initial images using a .jasonL 
file then apply some of algos to differentiate between **glomerulus** and **blood vessels**.
- Initially, we'll be working with tiles ( parts of a large image  ) after successful results they'll be tiled as
Whole Slide Images.
- After this, we'll apply some computer vision Project Principles to teach computers to produce efficient results on its own.
- This is the basic workflow of the project we'll update it as we go along.

## Info About mainCode.py
- This file will contain the main Source Code for the Project. 
- We'll add the description of all the functions here.
